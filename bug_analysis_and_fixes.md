# Bug Analysis and Fixes

## Bug 1: Memory Leak in useSimulation Hook

**Location**: `src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`

**Type**: Memory Leak / Resource Management Issue

**Description**: 
The `useSimulation` hook creates `AbortController` instances but doesn't properly clean them up when the component unmounts. This leads to memory leaks and potential race conditions where callbacks continue to execute after the component has been unmounted.

**Root Cause**: 
1. The `abortControllerRef` is set but never cleaned up on unmount
2. State updates can occur after component unmount, causing React warnings
3. No cleanup in the `useEffect` hook to handle component unmounting

**Impact**: 
- Memory leaks accumulate over time
- React warnings about state updates on unmounted components
- Potential crashes in production environments

**Fix Applied**: 
Added proper cleanup logic using `useEffect` with cleanup function to abort ongoing operations when the component unmounts.

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added mount tracking and cleanup
const isMountedRef = useRef(true);

// Cleanup on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    isMountedRef.current = false;
    if (abortControllerRef.current) {
      abortControllerRef.current.abort();
      abortControllerRef.current = null;
    }
  };
}, []);

// Added mount checks to prevent state updates after unmount
const addLog = useCallback((message: string) => {
  if (!isMountedRef.current) return;
  const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
  setLogs(prev => [...prev, `[${timestamp}] ${message}`]);
}, []);
```

## Bug 2: Race Condition in Auto-Simulation Feature

**Location**: `src/pages/ChipForgeWorkspace.tsx` (lines 129-137)

**Type**: Race Condition / Logic Error

**Description**: 
The auto-simulation feature has a race condition where multiple timers can be created simultaneously, leading to duplicate simulations running concurrently. The cleanup function only clears the most recent timer, leaving orphaned timers that can trigger unwanted simulations.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Multiple `useEffect` calls can create overlapping timers
2. The dependency array includes `isRunning` but doesn't prevent timer creation when simulation is already running
3. No proper synchronization between auto-simulation and manual simulation triggers

**Impact**: 
- Multiple concurrent simulations consume excessive resources
- Inconsistent UI state when multiple simulations complete
- Poor user experience with unexpected behavior

**Fix Applied**: 
Enhanced the auto-simulation logic with proper timer management and race condition prevention.

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Auto-simulate when code changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (autoSimulate && hasUnsavedChanges && !isRunning) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      // Double-check conditions before running simulation
      if (autoSimulate && !isRunning && hasUnsavedChanges) {
        handleRunSimulation();
      }
    }, 2000); // Debounce 2 seconds
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [hasUnsavedChanges, autoSimulate, isRunning, handleRunSimulation]);
```

**Key Improvements**:
1. Added double-check before running simulation
2. Moved useEffect after handler definition to fix dependency order
3. Added proper cleanup in dependency array

## Bug 3: Unsafe State Updates in useReflexion Hook

**Location**: `src/hooks/useReflexion.ts`

**Type**: Security Vulnerability / State Management Issue

**Description**: 
The `useReflexion` hook performs state updates without checking if the component is still mounted. This can lead to memory leaks and React warnings. Additionally, the hook doesn't properly handle cleanup when the component unmounts during an active reflexion process.

**Root Cause**: 
1. State updates continue after component unmount
2. No cleanup mechanism for ongoing async operations
3. Missing dependency in the `useCallback` hook dependencies

**Impact**: 
- React warnings about state updates on unmounted components
- Memory leaks from ongoing async operations
- Potential crashes when state updates occur on unmounted components

**Fix Applied**: 
Added proper cleanup logic and mount checking to prevent state updates after component unmount.

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added mount tracking and cleanup
const isMountedRef = useRef(true);

// Cleanup on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    isMountedRef.current = false;
    if (abortControllerRef.current) {
      abortControllerRef.current.abort();
      abortControllerRef.current = null;
    }
  };
}, []);

// Added mount checks to prevent state updates
const updateState = useCallback((updates: Partial<ReflexionState>) => {
  if (!isMountedRef.current) return;
  setState(prev => ({ ...prev, ...updates }));
}, []);

// Added mount checks throughout async operations
const runIteration = useCallback(async (...args) => {
  if (!isMountedRef.current) {
    throw new Error('Component unmounted during iteration');
  }
  // ... rest of the function with additional mount checks
}, [updateState]);
```

**Key Improvements**:
1. Added proper mount tracking with `isMountedRef`
2. Added cleanup on unmount to abort ongoing operations
3. Added mount checks before all state updates
4. Added mount checks throughout async operations
5. Fixed dependency array in `useCallback` hooks

## Summary

These bugs represent common patterns in React applications:
1. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of resources and subscriptions
2. **Race Conditions**: Managing concurrent operations and state updates
3. **Component Lifecycle**: Handling async operations across component mounts/unmounts

The fixes improve the application's stability, performance, and user experience while preventing potential memory leaks and crashes.

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Memory Management**: Prevents memory leaks by properly cleaning up resources
2. **Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary duplicate operations
3. **Stability**: Reduces crashes and React warnings
4. **User Experience**: Provides more predictable behavior
5. **Maintainability**: Makes the code more robust and easier to debug

These fixes follow React best practices for managing component lifecycle, async operations, and resource cleanup.
