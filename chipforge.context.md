# ChipForge Project Context

## **PROJECT STATUS UPDATE - WIZARD REMOVAL COMPLETE**

### **Latest Changes (Current Session):**
- ‚úÖ **REMOVED SchematicWizard component** - Eliminated "wizard concepts" as requested
- ‚úÖ **REMOVED wizard route** from App.tsx routing
- ‚úÖ **REMOVED "Schematic Wizard" navigation** from TopNav
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED GuidedMode** - Updated to work with integrated component library
- ‚úÖ **INTEGRATED Component Library** - Component library functionality is built directly into SchematicCanvas
- ‚úÖ **BUILD VERIFIED** - All changes compile successfully

### **What Was Removed:**
1. **SchematicWizard.tsx** - The multi-step wizard component
2. **/wizard route** - Wizard navigation path
3. **TopNav wizard link** - Navigation menu item
4. **Wizard-related imports** - Cleaned up App.tsx

### **What Was Enhanced:**
1. **GuidedMode.tsx** - Updated step descriptions to work with integrated component library
2. **SchematicCanvas.tsx** - Added proper CSS classes for guided mode targeting
3. **Component Library Integration** - Users can now browse, search, and drag components directly on the canvas

### **Current Architecture:**
- **No more wizard concepts** - Users follow guided mode through the integrated design process
- **Component library follows users** - Built directly into SchematicCanvas, no separate component needed
- **Guided mode navigation** - Step-by-step guidance through the integrated component library and canvas

### **Next Priority:**
Phase 2: Waveform Integration and HDL Generation
- Connect SchematicCanvas output to WaveformPlanner
- Implement basic HDL generation from schematics
- Test the complete design flow

### **Build Status:**
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: SchematicCanvas + Component Library Integration - **COMPLETE**
- üîÑ Phase 2: Waveform Integration - **NEXT**
- ‚è≥ Phase 3: HDL Generation - **PENDING**
- ‚è≥ Phase 4: Simulation Environment - **PENDING**
- ‚è≥ Phase 5: Synthesis & Layout - **PENDING**

### **Key Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Removed SchematicWizard import and route
- `src/components/chipforge/TopNav.tsx` - Removed wizard navigation
- `src/components/chipforge/GuidedMode.tsx` - Enhanced for integrated component library
- `src/components/chipforge/SchematicCanvas.tsx` - Added guided mode CSS classes

### **User Requirements Addressed:**
‚úÖ "i dont want the concept of wizards" - SchematicWizard removed
‚úÖ "I am using the guided process" - GuidedMode enhanced and integrated
‚úÖ "navigate them to each component" - GuidedMode now works with integrated component library
‚úÖ "What happened to the component library that follows the user through the process?" - It's integrated into SchematicCanvas, no separate component needed

The system now provides a seamless, guided experience where users can browse components, drag them to the canvas, and follow step-by-step guidance - all within the integrated SchematicCanvas environment.
